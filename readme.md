# Task Tracker
This is a full-stack project that allows users to track their tasks. The project is built using React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Bored REST API, and Bootstrap.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. You will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. In your root directory run **npm i** to install all dependencies and run **npm start** in the server directory and run **npm run dev** in the client directory to run the application.

To run the backend, you will need to have **node.js** and **MongoDB** installed. You will need to add the link to your database in the *db.js* file (server -> config -> db.js). 

## Usage
The task tracker allows users to add, edit, and delete their own tasks. Additionally, users can generate tasks by making a request to the Bored REST API.
